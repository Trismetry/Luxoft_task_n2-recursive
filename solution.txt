Project n 2
isMirror is recursive function so the solution is recursive 
it takes two trees, left and right as an argument
if trees are the mirror return true, otherwise false
the solution is based on simple if condition with the following 
 - root node's key must be same so I check the values
 - left subtree of left tree and right subtree of right tree should be mirrored
 - right subtree of right tree and left subtree of left tree should be mirrored
